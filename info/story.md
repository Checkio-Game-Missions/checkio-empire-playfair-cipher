Security, security, security. All our communication MUST be encrypted.
In the Museum of Human History we have found a rather interesting algorithm which we think might be useful.

The [Playfair cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher) or Playfair square,
is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher.
The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but bears the name of Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher.
